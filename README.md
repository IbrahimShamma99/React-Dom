# React DOM Mini

React DOM Mini is a toy renderer that I built as part of my React Conf 2019 talk, "Building a Custom React Renderer".

This repo is built with Create React App, and the renderer itself is in [`src/ReactDOMMini.js`](https://github.com/sophiebits/react-dom-mini/blob/master/src/ReactDOMMini.js).

For more detail, watch the talk online:
